The Crew Transfer System is mainly designed for employee transfer and It is a web application. This system can be used as a transfer module in companies or Industries. In this, the employee requests the admin to transfer from one city to another city, and the request is stored in the database. The admin has privileges to Approve and Refuse the transfer request. 

The employee can request for transfer using that system, and the request will be placed into the queue until the admin approves the transfer request. If there is no availability at the destination city (mentioned in the transfer request), then the admin will Refuse or leave the request in the queue until the availability of places at the destination city.

Swap module:

The Admin will wait until another request comes for the transfer then the admin will check if the source and destination of the employee's transfer requests are opposite then the admin will swap them. For example, If an employee wants to transfer from Mumbai to Delhi, and another employee wants to transfer from Delhi to Mumbai then the swap will happen. As it will lead to remain a constant number of employees in the companies.

The main purpose of the system is to prevent a lack of employees due to transfers by swapping the employees and helping the employees to get transferred.
